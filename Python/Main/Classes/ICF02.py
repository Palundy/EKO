        Waits until the (compensated) irradiance sensor readings stabilize within a certain threshold.

        Parameters:
            threshold (float): The threshold value below which the derivative of irradiance signal is considered stable.
                                Default is `1.5 (W/mÂ²)/s`.
            attempts (int | bool): The maximum number of attempts to check for stability. If set to `None`, the function
                                will run indefinitely until stability is reached. Default is `5`.
            measurement_amount (int): The number of measurements to take in each attempt. Default is `30`.

        Returns:
            bool: `True` if the sensor readings stabilize within the specified threshold, `False` otherwise.
